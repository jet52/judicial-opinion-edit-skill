## Rule 2.1. Mental Health Appeals

### (a) Filing Notice of Expedited Appeal
An expedited appeal from an order under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-29 may be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the supreme court within 30 days after entry of the order. Extensions of time to file a notice of appeal under this rule are not permitted.

The notice of appeal must specify the party or parties taking the appeal.

### (c) Motion for Temporary Stay and Specifications of Error
Any motion for a temporary stay must be served and filed with the notice of appeal along with specifications of error. Any stay granted by the district court before appeal remains valid only if a temporary stay request is filed with the supreme court with the notice of appeal. Once the supreme court acts on the stay request, any district court stay terminates.

### (d) Record on Appeal
Consists of the record required by Rule 10(a). A recording or agreed statement may substitute for transcript.

### (e) Briefs
- If no temporary stay motion: appellant's brief must be filed with the notice of appeal and served on opposing party at filing. Appellee's brief due within 7 days after service of appellant's brief.
- If temporary stay motion filed: appellant's brief due within 5 days after notice of appeal is filed. Appellee's brief due within 5 days after service of appellant's brief.

### (h) Application of Other Rules
All other appellate rules apply to the extent not inconsistent with N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-29 or this rule.

Key note: N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-29 requires a hearing within 14 days after the notice of appeal is filed.

Adopted April 1, 1983; amended March 1, 1998; March 1, 2003; March 1, 2008; March 1, 2011; Oct. 1, 2014; March 1, 2019.

### (b) Content of Notice of Appeal
Must specify the party or parties taking the appeal.

### (c) Motion for Temporary Stay and Specifications of Error
Same structure as Rule 2.1(c): temporary stay motion must accompany notice of appeal with specifications of error.

All other appellate rules apply to the extent not inconsistent with this rule.

## Rule 3. Appeal as of Right — How Taken

### (a) Filing the Notice of Appeal
An appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to the supreme court may be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the supreme court within the time allowed by Rule 4. Failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal and payment of any required docket fee does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the court to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.

### (b) Joint or Consolidated Appeals
When two or more parties are entitled to appeal and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal and proceed as a single appellant. Appeals may be consolidated by court order on its own motion, party motion, or stipulation.

### (c) Content of the Notice of Appeal
The notice of appeal must: (1) specify the party or parties taking the appeal; (2) designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed; (3) name the court to which the appeal is taken; and (4) in a civil case or post-conviction relief proceeding, include a preliminary statement of issues.

### (d) Service of the Notice of Appeal
The clerk of the supreme court must promptly file notice of filing with the district court clerk using the Odyssey system and serve notice by sending a copy to each party's counsel of record (excluding appellant's counsel), or to self-represented parties at last known address if they have no email. Failure to serve does not affect validity of the appeal.

## Rule 4. Appeal — When Taken

### (a) Appeal in a Civil Case
The time for appeal runs from service of notice of entry of the judgment or order. (Note: unlike the federal rule, which runs from "the date of entry," North Dakota shifts responsibility to counsel to serve notice.)

### (b) Cross-Appeals
If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file within 14 days after the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed, whichever ends later.

### (c) Filing Before Entry of Judgment
A notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision but before entry of the judgment or order is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.

### (d) Effect of Post-Judgment Motions — Civil Cases
If a party timely files any of the following motions under the N.D.R.Civ.P., the full time to appeal runs for all parties from service of notice of the entry of the order disposing of the last remaining motion:
- Motion to amend or make additional findings under Rule 52(b)
- Motion for relief under Rule 60 (if filed within 28 days after notice of entry of judgment)

Substance, not title, controls: a motion under any listed rule — whether titled as motion to alter, amend, vacate, for relief from judgment, or for reconsideration — tolls the appeal time. Only a motion filed within the time allowed by the N.D.R.Civ.P. tolls appeal time.

### (d) Effect of Post-Judgment Motions — Criminal Cases
If a defendant timely files a motion for new trial under N.D.R.Crim.P. Rule 33 (if based on newly discovered evidence, only if within 30 days of entry of judgment) or for arrest of judgment under Rule 34, the notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after entry of the order disposing of the last remaining motion, or within 30 days after entry of judgment, whichever ends later.

### (e) Termination of Parental Rights and Child Relinquishment
Appeals in TPR matters and N.D.C.C. ch. 14-15.1 proceedings are not governed by Rule 4 deadlines; they are expedited under Rule 2.2.

### Extension of Time
A 30-day extension for excusable neglect is added to the time for appeal provided by the applicable statute or rule. A party seeking extension should file a notice of appeal with the motion for extension.

### General Timing
The time limit does not prevent taking an appeal at any time after entry of judgment and before service of notice of entry.

## Rule 26. Computing and Extending Time

### (a) Computing Time
The following rules apply in computing any period of time specified in these rules or in any local rule, court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of computing time:

**(1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit.** When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time:
- (A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;
- (B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and
- (C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

**(2) Period Stated in Hours.** When the period is stated in hours:
- (A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the event that triggers the period;
- (B) count every hour, including hours during intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and
- (C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

**(3) Inaccessibility of the Clerk's Office.** Unless the court orders otherwise, if the clerk's office is inaccessible:
- (A) on the last day for filing under Rule 26(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or
- (B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 26(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

**(4) "Last Day" Defined.** Unless a different time is set by a statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:
- (A) for electronic filing, at midnight in the court's time zone;
- (B) for filing by mail or third-party commercial carrier, at the latest time for the method chosen for delivery to the post office or third-party commercial carrier; and
- (C) for filing by other means, when the clerk's office is scheduled to close.

**(5) "Next Day" Defined.** The "next day" is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.

**(6) "Legal Holiday" Defined.** As used in this rule, "legal holiday" means a day set aside as a holiday under N.D.C.C. §§ 1-03-01, 1-03-02 and 1-03-02.1.

### (b) Extending Time
For good cause, the court may extend the time prescribed by these rules or by its order to perform any act, or may permit an act to be done after that time expires. The court may not extend the time to file a notice of appeal, except as authorized by law.

### (c) Additional Time after Service by Mail or Third-Party Commercial Carrier
When a party may or must act within a specified time after being served, three days must be added after the period would otherwise expire, unless the document is delivered on the date of service stated in the proof of service. For purposes of this rule, a document that is served electronically is treated as delivered on the date of service stated in the proof of service.

Amended effective March 1, 2011.

## Quick Reference: Appeal Deadlines

| Case Type | Deadline | Rule |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Civil | From service of notice of entry of judgment/order | Rule 4(a) |
| Criminal | 30 days after entry of judgment (subject to post-judgment motion tolling) | Rule 4 |
| Cross-appeal | 14 days after first notice of appeal, or otherwise prescribed time, whichever is later | Rule 4(b) |

## Common Jurisdictional Issues to Check

1. Was notice of appeal filed within the time allowed by Rule 4 (or Rule 2.1/2.2)?
2. Did any post-judgment motion toll the appeal deadline under Rule 4(d)?
3. Was the tolling motion itself timely under the underlying procedural rules?
4. For mental health appeals: was the notice filed within the non-extendable 30-day window?
5. For TPR appeals: was the notice filed within 30 days and routed through Rule 2.2?
6. Does the order being appealed constitute a final, appealable judgment or order?
7. If interlocutory, is there a basis for permissive appeal or extraordinary writ?
