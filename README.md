# JetRedline

Appellate judicial opinion and bench memo editor and proofreader. Produces a Word document (.docx) with tracked changes showing proposed edits, plus a separate analysis document with explanations. Applies Garner's Redbook, Bluebook citation format, and style preferences drawn from Justice Jerod Tufte (ND Supreme Court).

The editing pipeline runs seven passes:

1. **Jurisdictional check** — verifies timeliness of appeal, procedural posture, and standard of review against the ND Rules of Appellate Procedure
2. **Style and grammar** — applies Redbook rules and plain-language preferences; produces structured edit list
3. **Citation check** — Bluebook format review (3A) and substantive verification of ND citations against local reference files and official sources (3B)
4. **Fact check** — verifies factual claims against party briefs and record materials
5. **Analytical rigor** — internal consistency, standard-of-review consistency, readability metrics, and (for opinions) structural completeness
6. **Brief matching** — confirms the opinion or memo addresses every argument raised by the parties
7. **Dissent/concurrence cross-check** — checks fair characterization and responsiveness between majority and separate writings

Passes 1–7 run as parallel subagents where possible. After all passes complete, the pipeline collects results and produces up to two outputs: a tracked-changes .docx (Pass 2 edits become tracked insertions/deletions; other pass findings become document comments) and a companion analysis document summarizing all findings.

## Analysis Document

The analysis document includes the following sections (some vary by document type):

- **Case Highlight** (opinions only) — case name, citation, disposition, and core holdings
- **Jurisdictional Notes** — timeliness, procedural posture, and standard of review issues
- **Summary of Edits** — overview of types and volume of changes
- **Fact Check** — table of factual claims verified against record materials
- **Brief Matching** — table showing whether each party argument is addressed
- **Internal Consistency** — name, date, and terminology discrepancies across the document
- **Standard of Review Consistency** — whether deference language matches stated standards
- **Readability Metrics** — Flesch-Kincaid grade, sentence length, passive voice, and nominalization density by section
- **Substantive Concerns** (opinions) — potential dicta, alternative rationales, ambiguity/vulnerability, logical issues, and dissent/concurrence cross-check
- **Memo Analysis** (memos) — issue completeness, balance of presentation, recommendation assessment, analytical gaps, and standard of review application
- **Citation Verification** — table with quote checks, substantive support assessments, and source links
- **Citation Format Issues** — Bluebook corrections
- **Style Notes** — significant style changes by category

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (CLI) installed
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (for document conversion)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

## Installation

### Claude Desktop

1. Download [`jetredline-skill.zip`](https://github.com/jet52/jetredline/releases/latest)
2. Open Settings > Features > Claude's Computer Use > Skills directory
3. Set the skills directory to a folder of your choice (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/`)
4. Copy `skill/` contents into `<skills-dir>/jetredline/`
5. Set up the Python venv and Node dependencies manually (see Option C above)

### Claude Projects (web)

1. Download [`jetredline-skill.zip`](https://github.com/jet52/jetredline/releases/latest) from GitHub
2. Open your Claude Project → Project Knowledge
3. Upload `jetredline-skill.zip`
4. Paste opinion text or upload .docx/.pdf files in conversation
5. Use the same trigger phrases ("edit this opinion", "edit this bench memo", etc.)

**Web mode limitations:**
- Produces markdown analysis only (no tracked-changes .docx)
- All passes run inline — no subagent delegation (may hit context limits on very long opinions)
- Citation verification uses web search instead of local opinion corpus (less reliable)
- No PDF splitting for large record packets (upload individual documents)

## Usage

Trigger phrases:

- "Edit this opinion"
- "Proofread this opinion"
- "Review this draft opinion"
- "Redline this opinion"
- "Redline this draft"
- "Redline this memo"
- "Edit this draft order"

Provide a `.docx` draft opinion in the working directory. Optionally include `.pdf` briefs or record materials for fact-checking.

   - Run `npm install` for the `docx` Node.js package

**Option B: From source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jet52/jetredline.git
cd jetredline
make install
```

**Option C: Manual**

```bash
# Copy skill files
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/jetredline
cp -a skill/* ~/.claude/skills/jetredline/

# Set up Python venv
cd ~/.claude/skills/jetredline
uv venv .venv
uv pip install defusedxml pikepdf textstat --python .venv/bin/python

# Install Node dependencies
npm install
```
